# Personal website


To make changes you first have to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Then run `hugo serve --watch` and head to `localhost:1313`.

To publish the changes just push to the `dev` branch, Travis will take care of compiling the website and pushing it to the `master` branch.

Theme using: [YinYang](https://github.com/joway/hugo-theme-yinyang) and [MaxHalford](https://github.com/MaxHalford/maxhalford.github.io)
