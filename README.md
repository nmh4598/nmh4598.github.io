# Personal website

Hey man, it's you back when you first made this website.

To make changes you first have to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Then run `hugo serve --watch` and head to `localhost:1313`.

To publish the changes just push to the `dev` branch, Travis will take care of compiling the website and pushing it to the `master` branch.
