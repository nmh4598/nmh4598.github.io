# About me

Bonjour, 

My name's Nguyen Manh Hung. I'm a fresh graduate. I have a Master's degree in Data Science, Statistics and Economics. I work at the intersection of economics and machine learning. I use my coding skills in Python to build models and analyze data. I've also dived into the world of Devops, and that's where Cloud comes into my journey.

From May 2022 to Aug 2022, I stepped into the realm of data as Data Scientist intern, specifically satellite data, at a consulting company name called [<span style="color:Green">WELOVEDATASCIENCE</span>](https://welovedatascience.com/) in Belgium. I researched unsupervised image classification based on land use using the NDVI index.

From May Sep 2022 to Sep 2023, I pursue a work-study program as a Apprentice Data Scientist at [<span style="color:#E30613">Mayenne Departement Council</span>](https://data.lamayenne.fr/pages/home/) in France. I created a data pipeline to collect data en batch from internal and external sources. I built a model to predict the unemployment rate in Mayenne, and I also developed a beautiful dashboard that monitors all the territorial observatory indicators, which you can observe [here](https://data.lamayenne.fr/pages/observatoire/#population-emploi-logement-revenus).
