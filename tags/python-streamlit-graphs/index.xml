It involves representing individuals as nodes and their relationships as edges to construct a network graph. Metrics like degree centrality, cluster analysis, and betweenness centrality can then reveal how information spreads, who the influential people are, and what communities exist within the network. It dives into Python code with NetworkX constructing and implying social networks from real datasets.</description></item></channel></rss>
