Hello ✌️

I'm a fresh graduate. I have a [Bachelor in Mathematics and Applications ](https://math.univ-rennes.fr/licence-de-mathematiques-l3) and i have also a [📊 Master's degree in Data Science, Statistics and Econometrics](https://sites-formations.univ-rennes2.fr/master-mas/components/formation/m2-rennes1.html) at University of Rennes, France. Before studying abroad, I studied in a major computer science class at 🎓[Chu Van An High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_V%C4%83n_An_High_School,_Hanoi), Hanoi. 

From May 2022 to Aug 2022, I embarked on a journey to extract meaningful insights from satellite imagery as Data Scientist intern at a consulting company name called [WELOVEDATASCIENCE](https://welovedatascience.com/) in Belgium. During my internship, I implemented routines for downloading and updating satellite tiles in NIS9 (division of Belgium into +/- 29,000 geospatial sectors) using [Sentinelsat](https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_overview.html) 🛰️.  And I researched classification techniques NDVI and NDWI index to identify land types ( water 🥏 and vegetation ☘️), estimate area coverage🍃, and detect specific features like pools and water bodies. 

From May Sep 2022 to Sep 2023, I pursue a work-study program as a Apprentice Data Scientist at Mayenne Departement Council in France. Mayenne is one of 100 departments of France. My Master topic in Mayenne was about Open Data, Open Source, Data Governance in public sector. Leveraging the power of open-source technologies like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), I created a data pipeline to collect data en batch from internal and external to reduce the financial 💸 burden associated with data acquisition and management. Besides that, I built a model to predict the unemployment rate in Mayenne, and I also developed a beautiful📊 dashboard that monitors all the territorial observatory indicators. It is open data so everyone can access it [here](https://data.lamayenne.fr/pages/observatoire/#population-emploi-logement-revenus), including you.

Now, i'm seeking a job as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer starting as soon as possible. Feel free to send me an email at [nguyenmanhhung04051998@gmail.com](mailto:nguyenmanhhung04051998@gmail.com) if you have an offer for me 🤝
